# Real-Time ASL Detection
## Bridging the communication gap between ASL speakers using machine learning.

### Overview
This project addresses the challenge of improving communication between ASL (American Sign Language) and English speakers by developing a real-time machine learning model capable of translating ASL letters. The model leverages computer vision techniques and neural networks to achieve this.

### Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Size:** 30,000 images
- **Features:** Diversity and realism to support robust model training.

### Key Technologies
- **MediaPipe Hands:** For detecting hand landmarks.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** For training the neural network.
- **OpenCV (CV2):** For real-time camera input and predictions.
- **Matplotlib:** For visualization and evaluation of the model.
